# MAGIC # Demo - Building Vector Search for Retrieval
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Overview
# MAGIC Welcome! In this demo, we’ll explore how to build a vector search solution for document retrieval using Databricks. We’ll walk through transforming document chunks into semantic vectors, creating a vector search index, and leveraging advanced search and re-ranking techniques to boost retrieval precision.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In real-world retrieval scenarios, converting unstructured documents into searchable semantic vectors enables more accurate and context-aware results. This workflow empowers you to efficiently find relevant information, even when keywords don’t match exactly.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Learning Objectives
# MAGIC - **Identify** the steps to compute document embeddings using the GTE model from Foundation Model APIs.
# MAGIC - **Configure** and create a vector search index using both SDK and UI methods.
# MAGIC - **Implement** and compare query, hybrid, and full-text search methods, including filtering by document path.
# MAGIC - **Improve** search precision through re-ranking and understand its impact on retrieval quality.
# MAGIC - **Apply** best practices for balancing computational cost, accuracy, and index refresh strategies.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Requirements
# MAGIC - A pre-created **vector search endpoint**. This is pre-created for you.
# MAGIC - **Serverless Compute (environment version 5)**. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/compute/serverless/dependencies#-select-an-environment-version) to select the appropriate environment version.
# MAGIC - Required libraries are added to **Dependencies** of Serverless compute configuration.
# MAGIC - Access to Foundation Model APIs for embedding generation.
# MAGIC - Appropriate permissions to create and manage vector search indexes.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Setup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Run the code below to install required libraries and configure your classroom environment. This step ensures all dependencies are available and your workspace is ready for the demo.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run ../Includes/Classroom-Setup-03

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## A. Prepare Source Table
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Vector Search requires the source table to have Change Data Feed (CDF) enabled. If the table already has this feature enabled, we don't need to make any changes. If not, we can enable it as follows.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Also, note that we need to have a unique ID for the table that will be required when creating the vector search index.

# COMMAND ----------

# Enable Change Data Feed for vector search synchronization
spark.sql(f"ALTER TABLE {docs_table} SET TBLPROPERTIES (delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true)")

# Display sample data to understand table structure
display(spark.sql(f"SELECT * FROM {docs_table} LIMIT 5"))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## B. Computing Embeddings for Document Chunks
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Embeddings are high-dimensional vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning, enabling powerful similarity search and retrieval. In Databricks, embeddings allow us to find contextually relevant document chunks, even when keywords do not match exactly.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks supports two main approaches for generating embeddings:
# MAGIC * **Managed embeddings:** Vector Search automatically computes and manages embeddings for you, simplifying setup and maintenance. This is the recommended approach for most use cases.
# MAGIC * **Manual embeddings:** You can generate embeddings externally (using MLflow Deployments, Hugging Face, OpenAI, etc.) and store them in a column. For large datasets, you can use a Spark UDF to compute embeddings for each row in a text column.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, we will use **managed embeddings**, allowing Vector Search to compute and maintain the embeddings for us. This approach streamlines the workflow and ensures compatibility with Databricks' vector search features.

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Compute and Display Embeddings
import mlflow.deployments

# Initialize deployment client for accessing embedding models
deploy_client = mlflow.deployments.get_deploy_client("databricks")

# Generate embeddings for a sample question
question = "How Generative AI impacts humans?"
response = deploy_client.predict(endpoint="databricks-gte-large-en", inputs={"input": [question]})
embeddings = [e["embedding"] for e in response.data]

# Display embedding information
print("Embedding for question:", embeddings[0])
print("Embedding shape:", len(embeddings[0]))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **💡 Question:** What does the `1024` embedding shape mean? Can this be changed for the embedding model we're using?__

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## C. Creating a Vector Search Index
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that we have embeddings, we’ll create a vector search index to enable fast and accurate retrieval. Databricks supports two main approaches:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **SDK Method:** Use the databricks-vectorsearch SDK to create an index with computed embeddings.
# MAGIC - **UI Method:** Use the Databricks UI to create an index with managed or computed embeddings.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We’ll use the pre-created vector search endpoint defined in the setup section. For instructions on creating an endpoint, refer to the [endpoint documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/vector-search/create-vector-search#create-a-vector-search-endpoint-using-the-ui).
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### C1. Creating Index via SDK
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this step, we'll create a vector search index using the Databricks SDK. We'll use managed embeddings, allowing Databricks to automatically compute and maintain vector representations for each chunk.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For more details, see the [Vector Search SDK documentation](https://api-docs.databricks.com/python/vector-search/index.html).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Note:** Index refresh modes can be set to manual or sync, depending on your update requirements.

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Code: Create Index Using SDK
from databricks.vector_search.client import VectorSearchClient

# Initialize the Vector Search client
vsc = VectorSearchClient(disable_notice=True)

# Define index name using three-level naming convention
index_name = f"{catalog}.{schema}.docs_chunked_index"

# Create the index using managed embeddings with Delta Sync
vsc.create_delta_sync_index_and_wait(
    endpoint_name=vector_search_endpoint,
    index_name=index_name,
    source_table_name=docs_table,
    primary_key='id',
    embedding_source_column="chunk",
    embedding_model_endpoint_name="databricks-gte-large-en",
    pipeline_type="TRIGGERED",
)
print(f"Index '{index_name}' created for table '{docs_table}' using endpoint '{vector_search_endpoint}'.")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### C1. Creating Index via UI (Optional)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We can also create a vector search index using the Databricks UI, which supports both managed and computed embeddings. This method is recommended for users who prefer a graphical interface or want to leverage managed embedding workflows.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For step-by-step instructions, see the [Vector Search UI documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/vector-search/create-vector-search#create-index-using-the-ui).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. In the left sidebar, click **Catalog** to open Catalog Explorer.
# MAGIC 2. Find and select your Delta table.
# MAGIC 3. Click **Create** (top right) and choose **Vector search index**.
# MAGIC 4. In the dialog, configure:
# MAGIC    * **Name:** Enter a three-level name (`<catalog>.<schema>.<name>`). Select catalog and schema from dropdown and enter name into the textbox.
# MAGIC    * **Primary key:** Select the unique ID column.
# MAGIC    * **Columns to sync:** (Standard endpoints only) Choose columns to include, or leave blank to sync all.
# MAGIC    * **Embedding source:** Choose to compute embeddings (select text column and model) or use an existing embedding column.
# MAGIC    * **Sync computed embeddings:** Toggle to save generated embeddings to a table.
# MAGIC    * **Vector search endpoint:** Select your endpoint.
# MAGIC    * **Sync mode:** Choose *Continuous* (auto sync) or *Triggered* (manual sync). Storage-optimized endpoints support only *Triggered*.
# MAGIC 5. Click **Create** and monitor index creation progress.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## D. Search Methods: Query, Hybrid, and Full-Text
# MAGIC
# MAGIC With the index in place, we can now perform searches using different methods:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Query Search:** Uses embeddings to find semantically similar chunks.
# MAGIC - **Hybrid Search:** Combines semantic and keyword-based search for improved relevance.
# MAGIC - **Full-Text Search:** Retrieves chunks based on exact keyword matches.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We’ll also demonstrate how to filter results by the `path` field to target specific documents.

# COMMAND ----------

# Get the vector search index for performing searches
index = vsc.get_index(index_name=index_name)
print(index.describe())

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### D1. Query Search: Similarity Search
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this step, we'll use the vector search index to perform a semantic search. This method retrieves document chunks that are contextually similar to our query, even if the exact keywords don't match. We'll use this approach to find relevant information based on meaning, not just keywords.

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Code: Query Search: Semantic Retrieval (Python)
query_text = "How does the Orion system prevent overheating during continuous operation?"
results = index.similarity_search(
    query_text=query_text,
    columns=["path", "chunk"],
    num_results=3
)
display(results)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### D2. Hybrid Search: Semantic + Keyword
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Hybrid search combines semantic similarity with keyword matching. This approach is useful when we want to balance contextual relevance with exact keyword hits, improving the precision of our search results.

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Code: Hybrid Search: Semantic + Keyword (Python)
query_text = "Explain safety verification under ISO 13849-1."
results_hybrid = index.similarity_search(
    query_text=query_text,
    columns=["path", "chunk"],
    query_type="hybrid",
    num_results=5
)
display(results_hybrid)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The model embedding may focus semantically on safety and verification but miss the specific standard reference if embeddings were trained mostly on general English text.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Keyword filtering on **"ISO 13849-1"** ensures only chunks mentioning the compliance standard are retrieved. Note that the first result includes **"ISO 13849-1"** while others don't.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### D3. Full-Text Search: Keyword Only
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Full-text search retrieves document chunks based exclusively on exact keyword matches. Use this method when you require highly precise, literal results for your search terms.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **🚨 Important:** Full-text search is **currently in beta** and must be enabled for your workspace before use. You can **unskip** the code cell below after enabling this feature. You can check [this documentation page](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/workspace-settings/manage-previews#-manage-account-level-previews) for instructions to enable a **preview** feature.

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Code: Full-Text Search
# MAGIC %skip
# MAGIC query_text = "PID coefficients"
# MAGIC results_fulltext = index.similarity_search(
# MAGIC     query_text=query_text,
# MAGIC     columns=["path", "chunk"],
# MAGIC     query_type="FULL_TEXT",
# MAGIC     num_results=5
# MAGIC )
# MAGIC display(results_fulltext)
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### D4. Filter by Path: Target Specific Documents
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We can use filtering to return results for specific documents. For example, we can filter search results by the `path` field to target only certain documents. This is useful when we want to restrict our search to a particular file or document within our dataset.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We'll use a `LIKE` filter here. Please note that filtering matches whitespace-separated tokens in a string. You can check the [documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/vector-search/query-vector-search) for other supported filters.

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Code: Filter by Path
query_text = "How does the Orion system prevent overheating during continuous operation?"
filtered_results = index.similarity_search(
    query_text=query_text,
    columns=["path", "chunk"],
    filters={"path LIKE" : "dbfs:/Volumes/main/default/documents/03_Orion_Motion_Controller_Firmware_Guide_v6.pdf"}, # TODO: Change the path if you used a different catalog and schema
    num_results=3
)

display(filtered_results)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **💡 Additional Filter Examples:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can use various filter types with vector search:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```python
# MAGIC # Filter by exact path match
# MAGIC filters={"path NOT": "specific/document/path.pdf"}
# MAGIC
# MAGIC # Filter by numeric ranges (if you have numeric metadata)
# MAGIC filters={"page_number >": 10, "page_number <": 50}
# MAGIC ```

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## E. Improving Precision through Re-Ranking
# MAGIC
# MAGIC While embeddings are powerful for finding semantically similar content, they may sometimes return results that are close in meaning but weak in context. Re-ranking helps boost precision by re-evaluating the top results using a more context-aware model or additional signals.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Why re-rank?**
# MAGIC - Embedding-based search can surface semantically similar but contextually irrelevant chunks.
# MAGIC - Re-ranking applies a secondary scoring step, often using a cross-encoder or LLM, to prioritize the most relevant results.
# MAGIC - In Databricks, you can use the built-in reranker to re-score and reorder the top N results from a similarity search, leveraging deeper contextual understanding.
# MAGIC - This improves the quality of the final output, especially for nuanced queries and critical use cases.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Trade-off:** Re-ranking increases computational cost but can significantly improve accuracy for high-value queries. Use reranking selectively to balance performance and precision.

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Code: Re-Rank Search Results Example
# Example: Re-rank top N results from a semantic search using DatabricksReranker

from databricks.vector_search.reranker import DatabricksReranker

query_text = "How does the Orion system prevent overheating during continuous operation?"
results_reranked = index.similarity_search(
    query_text=query_text,
    columns=["path", "chunk"],
    num_results=5,
    reranker=DatabricksReranker(columns_to_rerank=["chunk"])
)

display(results_reranked)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **💡 Question:** Compare these results with the results returned by similarity search at the beginning of this section. Do you see any improvements?

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## F. Best Practices for Vector Search
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Minimize embedding dimensionality when possible**
# MAGIC    Higher-dimensional embeddings (e.g., 1024-1536) may capture more nuance but increase latency and reduce throughput. Choose the lowest dimension that preserves retrieval quality.
# MAGIC    *Example:* If we test a 768-dim model and a 384-dim model and find similar retrieval accuracy, we should prefer the 384-dim variant for faster queries.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Keep `num_results` per query moderate (e.g., 10-100)**
# MAGIC    Requesting too many results increases scanning and latency; the documentation recommends staying in this range unless our use case justifies it.
# MAGIC    *Example:* Use `num_results=50` by default rather than `num_results=5000`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Select the correct endpoint SKU and size your index appropriately**
# MAGIC    Choose between "Standard" and "Storage-Optimized" endpoints based on vector count, dimension, query latency, and cost. Also ensure your index size stays within the capability of a vector search unit for optimal latency.
# MAGIC    *Example:* For <2 million vectors at 768 dimensions, use the Standard SKU; for >10 million vectors, consider Storage-Optimized.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. **Use filters and metadata to narrow retrieval scope**
# MAGIC    Attaching metadata (e.g., document type, path prefix, source) allows us to restrict searches via `filters` and avoid retrieving irrelevant chunks, improving relevance and performance.
# MAGIC    *Example:* Filter by `"document_type":"manual"` so only manuals are searched for "maintenance interval" queries.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 5. **Prefer ANN retrieval for speed; use hybrid (vector + keyword) when domain keywords matter**
# MAGIC    Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) retrieval gives highest QPS and lowest latency; hybrid search should only be used when keyword relevance (e.g., legal standard codes) is critical.
# MAGIC    *Example:* Use ANN for general "how to recalibrate sensor" queries; use hybrid when the query must match a specific standard like "ISO 13849-1".
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For more best practices, see the [Databricks Vector Search documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/vector-search-best-practices).
